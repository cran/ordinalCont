#' @details Ordinal regression analysis is a convenient tool for analyzing ordinal response variables 
#' in the presence of covariates. We extend this methodology to the case of continuous self-rating 
#' scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain assessment, or the Linear Analog 
#' Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality of life studies. Subjects are
#' typically given a linear scale of 100 mm and asked to put a mark where they perceive
#' themselves. These scales  measure subjects' 
#' perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their 
#' inherent nonlinearity.  Instead we treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a continuous scale. We 
#' express  the likelihood in terms of a function (the ``g function'') connecting the  
#' scale with an underlying continuous latent  variable. In the current version the g function 
#' is expressed with monotone increasing I-splines (Ramsey 1988).
#' The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying distribution of the 
#' latent variable. Currently 
#' the logit link, which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is implemented. 
#' (This implies a proportional odds model.)  The likelihood is 
#' maximized using the \code{MI} algorithm (Ma, 2010). Fixed- and mixed-effects models are implemented 
#' in the function \code{\link{ocm}}.

#' @title ANZ0001 trial
#' @description The complete ANZ0001 trial data set
#' @details  The ANZ0001 trial, conducted by the ANZ Breast Cancer Trials Group, is an unblinded, multi-centre, 
#' randomized trial with three chemotherapy treatment arms, concluded in 2005 (Stockler et al 2007). 
#' Health-related quality of life measures (Overall quality of life, Physical Well-Being, Mood, Pain, Nausea and 
#' Vomiting, Appetite) are assessed at each chemotherapy treatment cycle, from randomization until 
#' disease progression, when treatment is interrupted. 
#' The treatments Intermittent Capecitabine (IC) and Continuous Capecitabine (CC) are compared with the 
#' standard combination treatment CMF, each with its own protocol. 
#' There is no maximum duration of treatment, but it is interrupted on disease progression, or when patient 
#' intolerance or unacceptable toxicity are recorded.
#' The data set is extracted from the ANZ0001 trial and contains information from 292 patients with complete 
#' quality of life measurements.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#' \code{randno}\tab patient ID number \cr
