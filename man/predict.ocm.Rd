\title{Predict method for Continuous Ordinal Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{ocm}(object, newdata = NULL, ndens = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{ocm}, usually a result of a call to \code{ocm}}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with 
which to predict. 
Note that all predictor variables should be present, having the same names as the variables 
used to fit the model. If \code{NULL}, predictions are computed for the original dataset.}

\item{ndens}{the number of evenly spaced values of \code{v} over which the probability density is evaluated (default: 10)}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components: 
\item{mean}{a vector of length equal to the number of observations.
Each element is the mean of \code{v}, 
the  continuous ordinal random variable, conditional on the covariates in the model.}
\item{density}{a matrix with number of rows equal to the number of observations. Each row 
contains the values of the log density function of \code{v} conditional on the covariates in the 
model. 
The density function is calculated over \code{ndens} equally-spaced values of v in (0,1).}
\item{x}{a vector with the \code{ndens} equally-spaced values of \code{v} in (0,1) used to compute the 
density of v}
\item{formula}{the formula used to fit the model}
\item{newdata}{a new data frame used to make predictions. It takes value NULL if no new data frame has been used.}
}
\description{
Predicted values based on \code{ocm} object
}
\details{
An object of class \code{ocm} and optionally a new data 
frame are used to compute the probability 
densities of \code{v}, the continuous ordinal score. The estimated parameters 
of the fitted model and \code{ndens}
values of \code{v} are used to compute the probability densities and their means. If a new data frame is used to make predictions, the individual (random) effects are set to zero, while they are maintained to the estimated values if \code{newdata} is NULL.
